## 🛠️ WordPress Migration Tips & Recommendations

### 1. Global Header & Footer
- **Navigation Menu:** The navigation links in the header (`<nav class="top-nav">`) are identical on all pages. When coding a custom WordPress theme, register a navigation menu in `functions.php` and call it in `header.php` via `wp_nav_menu()`.
- **Navbar Styling:** The nav bar logo `.nav-logo` is styled to be prominent (height: `120px` with a scale micro-animation on hover).
- **Footer:** The site footer (`<footer class="site-footer bg-light-blue">`) is identical on all pages and should be converted into `footer.php`.

### 2. Interactive Galleries & Lightbox
- **Static implementation:** The "Summer Camps" page, news galleries, homepage "Behind the Scenes", and the "A Christmas Carol" page use a custom HTML5 `<dialog>` component with JavaScript to show popup pictures and enable left/right arrow and keyboard navigation.
- **WordPress Translation:** Instead of recreating custom JS, you can use WordPress gallery plugins (such as **Envira Gallery**, **FooGallery**, or native Gutenberg/Elementor gallery blocks with a lightbox add-on) to build these pages. This makes it easier for admin users to add/remove photos in the future.

### 3. Student Spotlights
- **Static implementation:** The student spotlights in [news.html](news.html) dynamically repeat using JavaScript and support a "Read More" modal.
- **WordPress Translation:** You can represent these by setting up a **Custom Post Type (CPT)** for "Spotlights" in WordPress (using plugins like *Custom Post Type UI* or writing it in PHP). This allows Linda/staff to easily add new spotlights in the WordPress dashboard without editing code.

### 4. Custom Styling
- All custom designs, alignments, grids, and responsive behaviors are stored in [style.css](style.css). This file can be used as the base stylesheet (`style.css`) for a custom WordPress theme.
